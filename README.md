# STACKED

## Description

This application allows the public and more specifically bootcamp students to access the class resources in a more timely manner. The user is able to search, using keywords, for code learned in the bootcamp and can see where the topic is introduced, the docs url, and where the code is used within the bootcamp repository. Users are also able to view three categories of web developer resources; Resources, Job Articles and Interview Articles. On that same page, the user can view a couple Q&A articles about the current bootcamp instructor and a beloved TA. The last aspect of that page is the ability to add a resource of your own by either signing up for the first time and/or logging in and submitting a url. The application ultimately gives users the ability to search out tedious data in a more efficient way than going through each week, folder and activity of the bootcamp individually.
